# larpWikiAnomalyScanner

Scans downloaded text files containing wiki page sources from the german
[LARP-Wiki](https://www.larpwiki.de/LarpWikiAnomalyScanner) for anomalies like
invalid UTF-8 encoding or syntax errors. It also focus on artifacts caused by a
not-so-recent migration from [UseMod](http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl) to
the current [MoinMoin](https://moinmo.in) engine.

It may or may not also be suitable for analyzing other MoinMoin wikis' page
sources. It also may or may not be a good base for writing an analyzer for other
wiki's page sources

## License

This tool has been released into the public domain. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) or
http://unlicense.org for details.

## Usage

Configure the folder containing the downloaded page source files in sourceDir
and execute the script.

When running on non-Windows in a terminal (emulator), the script output respects the width of the
terminal screen.
When the terminal supports ANSI codes, the output is colored.

## History

__V1__ has been released December 2012.

__V2__, released December 2017, was a maintenance release and fixed a crash
when encountering broken UTF-8 by implementing byte-wise parsing of UTF-8 and
proper reporting. Also, the tool moved to a GIT repository and Github.

__V3__, released January 2018, improved performance a lot. Multiprocessing got
implemented and some slow code has been rewritten.
Refactorings leading to better changeability began.
